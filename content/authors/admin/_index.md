Lin Cunzhi is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence. Interests include artificial intelligence, distributed robots, embedded systems, life sciences, and more. During my time in school, I led a team to participate in multiple competitions and won multiple awards, including the second prize in the RoboCom Robot Developer Competition National Finals. I also published an invention patent and several software copyrights, obtained other copyright certificates, including poetry, and created the "Taiyin Network Studio" to independently develop small software. Focusing on cultivating one's own innovation ability and comprehensive qualities, aiming to become the driving force for the development of science and technology in the 21st century.
