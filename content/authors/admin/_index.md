# Alice Wu is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. Her research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
Lin Cunzhi is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence. Interests include artificial intelligence, distributed robots, embedded systems, life sciences, and more. During my time in school, I led a team to participate in multiple competitions and won multiple awards, including the second prize in the RoboCom Robot Developer Competition National Finals. I also published an invention patent and several software copyrights, obtained other copyright certificates, including poetry, and created the "Taiyin Network Studio" to independently develop small software. Focusing on cultivating one's own innovation ability and comprehensive qualities, aiming to become the driving force for the development of science and technology in the 21st century.
# 林存智，人工智能本科在读。兴趣包括人工智能、分布式机器人、嵌入式、生命科学等。在校期间带领团队参加多项比赛并获得包括RoboCom机器人开发者大赛全国决赛二等奖在内的多项奖项，同时发表一篇发明专利及数篇软件著作权，获得包括诗歌在内的其他著作权证书，创建[太殷网络工作室]、能独立开发小型软件。注重于自身创新能力和综合素质的培养，旨在不久的将来成为21世纪科技发展的强力推动者之一。
